   hi
     ",A brief exchange of greetings between two people.,"Here are some tips to help you engage in the conversation:

1. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Instead of yes or no questions, ask something that requires a more detailed response. For example, “What’s something interesting you’ve done recently?”

2. **Share Something About Yourself**: Relate to the other person by sharing a bit about your own experiences. This could be something like, “I recently started reading an interesting book—do you enjoy reading?”

3. **Show Genuine Interest**: Respond enthusiastically. For instance, if they mention a hobby or interest, ask more about it. You could say, “That sounds fun! How did you get into that?”

4. **Use Follow-Up Questions**: If they mention something intriguing, follow it up with another question. For example, “What do you like most about it?”

5. **Keep It Light**: Sometimes humor or light topics can be a great way to keep the conversation flowing. You could bring up a funny incident or ask about favorite movies or shows.

6. **Mention Current Events or Trends**: If appropriate, you might introduce a current event or popular topic that could spark interest. For example, “Did you hear about the latest movie release? What do you think about it?”

7. **Find Common Ground**: Look for shared interests or experiences. You might say, “I love traveling too! What’s your favorite place you’ve visited?”

8. **Be Present**: Show that you’re engaged in the conversation by actively listening and responding thoughtfully to what the other person says.

Remember, conversations are a two-way street. Encourage the other person to share while also contributing your own thoughts!","[0, 1]"
