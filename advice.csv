6. **Express Curiosity**: Show that you're interested in learning more. Ask, ""What resources or studies have influenced your understanding of AI development?""

7. **Acknowledge Counterarguments**: Recognize that there are multiple sides to the debate. You might say, ""While AI can displace jobs, it might also create new roles. How do you see that balance playing out?""
