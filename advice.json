I\u2019ve been busy with work, but it\u2019s been good.\u201d\n\n2. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Keep the conversation flowing by asking questions that encourage more than yes\/no answers.

If they mention something exciting, ask them to elaborate. \u201cOh, that sounds cool!

Even if discussing challenges, try to highlight the silver lining or lessons learned.\n\n7. **Use Humor**: If appropriate, sprinkle in some light-hearted humor to create a relaxed atmosphere.\n\n8. **Mind Body Language and Tone**: If this is a face-to-face conversation, maintain an open posture, make eye contact, and use a friendly tone to encourage a positive dialogue.\n\n9. **Follow Up**: If they share something significant, remember it for future conversations.
